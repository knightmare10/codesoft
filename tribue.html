            Bose received his early education at a local school in Cuttack,
            and later attended Protestant European School in the city. 
            He then went on to study at Ravenshaw Collegiate School in Cuttack.
             In 1913, he passed the matriculation examination and in 1915, 
             he passed the Intermediate Examination with a scholarship.<br/>

                In 1919, Bose graduated with a first class honors degree in philosophy and
             was awarded the prestigious Rajendra Prasad scholarship to study at Cambridge University. 
             However, in 1920, he failed the Indian Civil Services Examination. In 1921, Bose was re-appeared
              for the Indian Civil Services Examination and passed, but resigned from his position in April 1921.

            Bose then joined the Indian National Congress and actively
        participated in the Indian independence movement. He was a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi 
        and Jawaharlal Nehru, but later broke away from them due to ideological differences. In 1939, 
      he formed the Forward Bloc, an organization aimed at unifying all the anti-British forces in India.

        In April 1941 Bose arrived in Nazi Germany, where 
         leadership offered unexpected but equivocal sympathy
          for India's independence.[19][20] German funds were 
          employed to open a Free India Centre in Berlin.
           A 3,000-strong Free India Legion was recruited 
           from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps to 
           serve under Bose.[21][j] Although peripheral to their main goals,
            the Germans inconclusively considered a land invasion of India throughout 1941.
             By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in Russia and Bose became keen to
              move to southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories.[23] Adolf Hitler
               during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 offered to arrange a submarine.
               [24] During this time, Bose became a father; his wife,[6][k] or companion,[25][l] Emilie 
               chenkl, gave birth to a baby girl.[6][m][19] Identifying strongly with the Axis powers,
                Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943.[26][27] Off Madagascar, he was transferred 
                to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943.[26]
